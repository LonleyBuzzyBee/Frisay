        <h2>ruby</h2>
        <p>"Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.
        Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, Basic, and Lisp."</p>

        <h2>c#</h2>
        <p>"C# (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note C♯, but written with the number sign)[b] is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.[16] It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative, and later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2018). Mono is the name of the free and open-source project to develop a compiler and runtime for the language. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads Torgersen. The most recent version is 8.0, which was released in 2019 alongside Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3."</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)"> source</a>

        <h2>go</h2>
        <p>"Go, also known as Golang,[14] is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google[15] by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.[12] Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,[6] and CSP-style concurrency.[16]There are two major implementations:
          <ul>
            <li>Google's self-hosting[17] compiler toolchain targeting multiple operating systems, mobile devices,[18] and WebAssembly.[19]</li>
              <li>gccgo, a GCC frontend.[20][21]</li>
          </ul>
        A third party transpiler, GopherJS,[22] compiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development."</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)"> source</a>

        <h2>javascript</h2>
        <p>"JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area."</p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript">source</a>
